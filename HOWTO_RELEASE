1. Verify that the versions currently set (see 10 and 11 below) make
   sense for this release.

2. Run 'make distcheck', fix any problem with it.

3. Update the NEWS file (extract most important things from the
   repository log). Make sure to update the release date

4. Commit the changes in the NEWS file.

5. Tag the release:
   $ git tag MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

6. Run 'make dist-bzip2'.
   $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make dist-bzip2

7. Verify that you can unpack and build the tarball

8. Copy the tarball to upload.osgeo.org:/osgeo/download/geos

9. Increment all the version numbers for the next release, as below.

10. Increment CAPI_INTERFACE_X in configure.ac
    - For a release with no interface changes just bump REVISION.
      [ Even if *nothing* changed in CAPI ]
    - Adding interfaces, bump CURRENT/AGE, set REVISION to 0.
    - Deleting interfaces / compatibility issues - bump CURRENT, others to zero
      [ THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED ]

11. Increment release versions in Version.txt

      - GEOS_VERSION_PATCH
      - GEOS_VERSION_MINOR
      - GEOS_VERSION_MAJOR

      - CAPI_INTERFACE_CURRENT
      - CAPI_INTERFACE_REVISION
      - CAPI_INTERFACE_AGE

      Always increase the revision value.
      Increase the current value whenever an interface has been added, removed or changed.
      Increase the age value only if the changes made to the ABI are backward compatible.

12. Update wiki page https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ at Download section
    - Add latest release
    - Remove previos patch level release (if any)

13. Announce
